# You Can Just Self-Host Next.js

### October 11, 2025

Next.js has become a powerful framework for building modern web applications, but many developers don't realize how straightforward it can be to self-host your Next.js applications.

## Why Self-Host?

- **Control**: Complete control over your infrastructure
- **Cost Efficiency**: Potentially lower costs for high-traffic sites
- **Performance**: Optimize for your specific use cases
- **Privacy**: Keep your data and code on your own servers

> Most developers assume deployment requires Vercel, but self-hosting gives you complete control over your infrastructure.

## How to Self-Host Next.js

1. Build your application with `next build`
2. Use `next start` to run a production server
3. Set up a process manager like PM2
4. Configure your web server (Nginx/Apache) as a reverse proxy

```bash
# Example PM2 setup
pm2 start npm --name "my-nextjs-app" -- start
```

For handling environment variables, create a `.env.production` file:

```javascript
// Load environment variables in next.config.js
const nextConfig = {
  env: {
    API_URL: process.env.API_URL,
    ANALYTICS_ID: process.env.ANALYTICS_ID,
  },
};
```

Self-hosting doesn't have to be complicated, and for many projects, it's the perfect solution.
